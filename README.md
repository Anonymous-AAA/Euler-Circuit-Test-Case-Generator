# Euler-Circuit-Test-Case-Generator
An okayish python script to generate a random Euler circuit with given number of vertices and edges.


## Executing the Script
Just use your python ide or terminal commands to run the script and give the number of vertices and edges as asked.

## Very Very Important
The program will run into infinite loop if the euler circuit does  not exist.Just stop the execution. There might be cases where euler circuit exists and it runs into an infinite loop, don't kill me for that. I don't guarantee 100% accuracy for this program. You can always verify yourself.

## Sample Input and Output
```
Enter number of vertices:6
Enter number of edges:11
6
11
1 3
5 1
5 3
4 2
2 3
0 4
1 2
5 0
4 3
5 2
1 4



One of the possible outputs:
5 2
2 3
3 4
4 0
0 5
5 3
3 1
1 4
4 2
2 1
1 5
```

## Disclaimer
I am not promising you 100% accuracy for this script. It works for me so I am sharing it. If it works for you share it too.
